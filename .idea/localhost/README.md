#Fiskenatet


I.Introduction
--------------

#Fiskenatet is auction site specialised in fish and seafood auctions, the target groups are retail, restaurants, hotels and occasionally private people.
The main idea with the site is to save the buyers time and effort. As a buyer its not requiered to attend the auction since you 
can monitor everything on your computer and that will save the buyer valuable time. #Fisken�tet also supplies with storage for up to 24 hours after the purchase so the fish stays fresh until pickup/delivery.
The auction winner can choose to pickup the winning auction or to get it delivered.

VI.Bugs&issues
---------------
When updating a user, if the user already has bought/won an ad (eg. the user has his username listed under buyer_username
in the history table in the database.), then the user will be prompted that the username is already in use even if the user
don't want to change his current username.
